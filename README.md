I can help format your project details for a visually appealing presentation, but since this environment doesn't support rich text formatting (such as adjusting font sizes or styles), I recommend using a document or presentation editor like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or PowerPoint, where you can adjust font sizes, bold, italics, and use headings.

Here’s how to present your content with formatting suggestions for a professional, visually engaging presentation:
